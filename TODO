TODO
----

- chroot qemu by calling "qemu -chroot $bundle_dir"
  (need to define @BUNDLE_DIR@ for hypervisor.args).
- Since docker container names can be long, we should permit a
  partial, unique container name to be specified to all commands that
  accept a container id.
- Switch to g_build_path() rather than PATH_MAX arrays (smaller binary
  and safer, at the cost of speed [how much?]).
- Use g_autofree for strings (minimise code leaks, code clarity).
- Rewrite clr_oci_expand_cmdline() and/or clr_oci_replace_string() to
  avoid the hundreds of calls to clr_oci_replace_string().
- Update clr_oci_get_iso8601_timestamp() to log in nano-second
  resolution (as runc already does).
- Rather than redirecting stdin/out/err for the qemu-lite process, we
  could run it with "-chardev serial path=/dev/pts/XX" where that device
  is the value passed from containerd.
- Do something with the annotations!
- Do something with hostname.
- Do something with process.user.
- Permit '#' comments in "hypervisor.args".
- Convert json-generating code to use json_builder_new ()? (it's more understandable!)
